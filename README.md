2015 - 2016 CS Capstone Project Frontend

This project is an incomplete frontend for a 2015 - 2016 Palo Alto High School CS Capstone project. The original purpose was to create a display for tasks following the crtical path methodology with a Sugiyama tree format. In the project's current state, nodes can be created and linked, although there is no connection to tasks,CPM, or the Sugiyama method.
